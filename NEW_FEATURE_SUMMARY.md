# New Feature Added: Person Sheets üë§

## What's New?

You can now create individual sheets for each person showing only their assigned tasks!

## Quick Start

### 1. Add People to Settings
In your Settings sheet, add names to `E13:E20`:
```
E13: John Smith
E14: Jane Doe
E15: Bob Wilson
...
```

### 2. Assign Tasks
In any task sheet, use Column F dropdown to assign tasks to people.

### 3. Generate Person Sheets
Click: **Task Tools ‚Üí üë§ Update Person Sheets**

### 4. View Personal Tasks
Each person gets their own sheet showing:
- All tasks assigned to them
- From: Carpark, Waiting, To Do, In Progress, Completed
- Sorted by priority
- Editable Status column for moving tasks

## What Changed?

### Column Layout Update ‚ö†Ô∏è
Column F is now "Who" (assigned person), so all subsequent columns shifted:

**Old Layout:**
- F = Due Date
- G = Status  
- H = Date Completed
- I = Last Updated
- J = Created Date

**New Layout:**
- F = **Who** (NEW)
- G = Due Date
- H = Status
- I = Date Completed
- J = Last Updated
- K = Created Date

### Menu Update
New menu item: **üë§ Update Person Sheets**
